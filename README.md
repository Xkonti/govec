## Installation

go get github.com/xkonti/govec
```

## Usage

### Vector types

The library provides the following vector types:
- `V2F[T]` - 2D floating point vector, where `T` is the type of the vector components (`float32` or `float64`)
- `V2I[T]` - 2D integer vector, where `T` is the type of the vector components (`int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32` or `int64`)
- `V3F[T]` - 3D floating point vector, where `T` is the type of the vector components (`float32` or `float64`)
- `V3I[T]` - 3D integer vector, where `T` is the type of the vector components (`int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32` or `int64`)

### Creating new vectors

Vectors can be created in various ways:
- Constructing vectors manually:
    ```go
    vector1 := govec.V2F{1.0, 2.0};
    vector2 := govec.V3F{1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
    vector3 := govec.V2I{1, 2};
    vector4 := govec.V3I{1, 2, 3};
    ```
- Using the [`New`](new.go) function, which takes the vector components as arguments:
    ```go
    vector1 := govec.NewV2F(1.0, 2.0);
    vector2 := govec.NewV3F(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
    vector3 := govec.NewV2I(1, 2);
    vector4 := govec.NewV3I(1, 2, 3);
    ```
- Using the [`Fill`](new.go) function, which assigns the same value to all components of a vector:
    ```go
    vector1 := govec.FillV2F(1.0);
    vector2 := govec.FillV3F(1.0);
    vector3 := govec.FillV2I(1);
    vector4 := govec.FillV3I(1);
    ```
- Using the [`Zero`](new.go) function, which creates a vector with all components set to 0:
    ```go
    vector1 := govec.ZeroV2F();
    vector2 := govec.ZeroV3F();
    vector3 := govec.ZeroV2I();
    vector4 := govec.ZeroV3I();
    ```
- Using the [`One`](new.go) function, which creates a vector with all components set to 1:
    ```go
    vector1 := govec.OneV2F();
    vector2 := govec.OneV3F();
    vector3 := govec.OneV2I();
    vector4 := govec.OneV3I();
    ```
- Using [`...FromArray`](array.go)
- Using [`...FromSlice`](slice.go)
  
### Conversions

Vectors can be converted to other types using the `To...` functions:
```go
vector1 := govec.V3F{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}; // Creates a 3D floating point vector (float64)
vector2 := vector1.ToV3I16(); // converts to 3D vector with int16 components
```

2D vectors have the following conversion functions:
- `ToV2F64`, `ToV2F32`, `ToV2I64`, `ToV2I32`, `ToV2I16`, `ToV2I8`, `ToV2I`

3D vectors have the following conversion functions:
- `ToV3F64`, `ToV3F32`, `ToV3I64`, `ToV3I32`, `ToV3I16`, `ToV3I8`, `ToV3I`

You can remove a component from a vector using the [`Discard`](discard.go) function:
```go
v1 := govec.V3F{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}; // Creates a 3D floating point vector (float64)
v2 := vector1.DiscardY(); // Returns a 2D vector with the Y component removed (v1.X -> v2.X, v1.Z -> v2.Y)
```

You can add a component to a vector using the [`Extend`](extend.go) function:
```go
v1 := govec.V2F{1.0, 2.0}; // Creates a 2D floating point vector (float64)
v2 := v1.Extend(3.0); // Returns a 3D vector with the Z component added.
```

You can insert a component to a vector using the [`Insert`](insert.go) function:
```go
v1 := govec.V2F{1.0, 2.0}; // Creates a 2D floating point vector (float64)
v2 := v1.InsertY(3.0); // Returns a 3D vector with the new component: newY -> Y, oldY -> Z.
```

You can swap components in a vector using the [`Swizzle`](swizzle.go) function:
```go
v1 := govec.V3F{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}; // Creates a 3D floating point vector (float64)
v2 := v1.SwizzleZYX(); // Returns a 3D vector with the components swapped (v1.Z -> v2.X, v1.Y -> v2.Y, v1.X -> v2.Z)
v3 := v1.SwizzleYZX(); // Returns a 3D vector with the components swapped (v1.Y -> v2.X, v1.Z -> v2.Y, v1.X -> v2.Z)
```

### Common variants

Most vector operations are available in various forms:
- Default form - returns a new vector, usually takes other vector as an argument
- `InPlace` form - modifies the original vector, usually takes other vector as an argument
- `Comp` form - returns a new vector, usually takes raw vector components as arguments instead of another vector
- `CompInPlace` form - modifies the original vector, usually takes raw vector components as arguments instead of another vector
- `Scalar` form - returns a new vector, takes a scalar value as an argument
- `ScalarInPlace` form - modifies the original vector, takes a scalar value as an argument

For example, the [`Add`](add.go) operation is available as:
- [`Add`](add.go) - takes another vector as an argument and returns a new vector
- [`AddInPlace`](add.go) - takes another vector as an argument and modifies the original vector
- [`AddComp`](add.go) - takes raw vector components (x, y, z) as arguments and returns a new vector
- [`AddCompInPlace`](add.go) - takes raw vector components (x, y, z) as arguments and modifies the original vector
- [`AddScalar`](addScalar.go) - takes a scalar value as an argument and returns a new vector
- [`AddScalarInPlace`](addScalar.go) - takes a scalar value as an argument and modifies the original vector

For some operations, the `Comp`, `InPlace` or `Scalar` variants are not available as it doesn't make sense to use them.

### Return type exceptions

Usually the return type of the operation is the same as the type of the vector on which the operation is performed. However,
in some cases the return type is different. Examples:
- `Len` operation always returns `float64` even if the vector is an integer vector. This is the only way to return an accurate
  length of the vector.
- `Norm` operations always returns a `float64` vectors even if the original vector is an integer vector. Normalization
  returns values between 0 and 1, which is not possible to represent in an integer vector.
